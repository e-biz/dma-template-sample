/**
 * Created by Loic Ortola on 15/07/2014.
 * This sample demonstrates two things:
 * 1-The ability to use the XWalk view from the Crosswalk library
 * which implements the latest chromium features, especially WebGl compatibility
 * 2-The ability to run a XML3D app from android
 * The XML3D poi-client project is developed and sustained by Stefan Lemme
 * source code available on https://github.com/stlemme/poi-client
